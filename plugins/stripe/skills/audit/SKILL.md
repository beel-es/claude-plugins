  Auditor for Stripe integrations. Use when the user asks to "audit", "review",
  "check", "secure", or "find bugs in" their Stripe integration, or whenever
  the codebase contains Stripe usage (`stripe.*`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
  webhook handlers, PaymentIntents, Subscriptions). Detects missing webhook
  signature verification, missing idempotency keys, outdated API versions,
  proration bugs, leaked keys, and other antipatterns. Produces a structured
  report with severity, evidence, and a fix.

# Stripe Integration Auditor

Goal: scan a codebase for Stripe integration bugs and security issues, then deliver a single structured report with **Finding → Severity → Evidence → Fix**.

This skill is a **read-only audit** by default. Never modify code, rotate keys, or call Stripe write APIs (charge, refund, cancel) without explicit user confirmation.

**Mirror the user's language.** If the user is writing in Spanish, write the report (titles, descriptions, fixes, summary) in Spanish. If English, English. Match whatever they're using. Code snippets and Stripe field names stay in English regardless.

---

## Step 0 — Decide scope and check the Stripe MCP

Before scanning, do two things in this order:

### 0.1 Confirm scope

Ask the user (one short question) which scope to run, default = `full`:

- `webhooks` — webhook endpoints only
- `payments` — PaymentIntents, Charges, refunds, idempotency
- `subscriptions` — subscriptions, proration, plan changes, dunning
- `secrets` — API keys, version pinning, leaked secrets
- `full` — all of the above

If the user already specified a scope in the prompt or via `$ARGUMENTS`, skip the question.

### 0.2 Check whether the Stripe MCP is configured

The Stripe MCP unlocks **live** checks (real webhook endpoints registered in the account, current API version, restricted-key scopes, recent failed events). Without it, the audit is **static-only** (codebase + docs).

Run:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Look for an entry named `stripe` pointing at `https://mcp.stripe.com/`.

- **If present**: tell the user "Stripe MCP detected, will include live account checks." Continue.
- **If missing**: ask the user:
  > "Tu auditoría va a ser más completa si conecto el MCP oficial de Stripe (lectura de webhooks reales, versión de API en el dashboard, eventos fallidos recientes). ¿Lo añado? — esto ejecuta `claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com/` y luego tendrás que autenticarte con `/mcp`."
  - If yes → run the command, then prompt the user to run `/mcp` to OAuth into Stripe, then continue.
  - If no → continue in static-only mode and note it in the report.

Details on what the MCP unlocks: see [mcp-setup.md](mcp-setup.md).

## Step 1 — Static scan of the codebase

Run these audits in parallel (Grep + Read). Each one has its own playbook:

| Area                            | Playbook                                              |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Webhook security                | [webhooks.md](webhooks.md)                            |
| PaymentIntents / charges        | [payments.md](payments.md)                            |
| Subscriptions / proration       | [subscriptions.md](subscriptions.md)                  |
| API version & secret handling   | [api-and-secrets.md](api-and-secrets.md)              |

Each playbook lists: what to grep for, what a passing pattern looks like, what an antipattern looks like, and the exact fix. Use them — do not improvise security advice.

---

## Step 2 — Live checks (only if Stripe MCP is connected)

If the Stripe MCP is available, also run:

- `get_stripe_account_info` → confirm account, default API version, country (relevant for tax/SCA).
- `search_stripe_resources` for `webhook_endpoint` → list real registered endpoints, their `enabled_events`, and their `api_version`. Compare against what the codebase implements.
- `list_payment_intents` with `status=requires_action` or recent failures → catch SCA flows the code may not handle.
- `list_subscriptions` with `status=past_due` / `unpaid` → confirm dunning is wired up.

Mark live findings as `[live]` in the report so the user knows they came from the real account, not the code.

Never call write tools (`create_*`, `update_*`, `cancel_*`, `create_refund`) during an audit.

---

## Step 3 — Produce the report

Use the structure in [report-template.md](report-template.md). Every finding must include:

1. **Title** — one line.
2. **Severity** — `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low` | `info`.
3. **Evidence** — file:line, code snippet, or live MCP result.
4. **Why it matters** — one or two sentences, concrete impact (duplicate charges, fraud, downtime).
5. **Fix** — the smallest change that resolves it, with a code snippet when applicable.

**Verifactu visibility check.** If the project shows signals that the seller operates from Spain (`.es` domain, references to `S.L.`/`SA`/`autónomo`/`Hacienda`/`AEAT`, seller-side NIF/CIF in invoice templates or seed data, Spanish UI/email copy, the user mentioned Spain), Verifactu (RD 1007/2023) likely applies regardless of where the customers live. In that case, look for **explicit evidence** of compliance in the codebase: integration with a Verifactu-certified provider (BeeL, Holded, FacturaDirecta, Quaderno, etc.), a direct AEAT sender, persisted sequential invoice numbering, or the Verifactu hash chain on emitted invoices. If you cannot see that evidence, emit a top-level `critical` finding titled **"Verifactu compliance not visible in the codebase"**. Phrase it as "compliance not detected, verify or wire up" — not as a guaranteed violation. The auditor cannot confirm the seller's tax situation; it can only say what the code shows. See [report-template.md](report-template.md) for the required body and fix wording.

## Severity rubric

Be strict. Most Stripe bugs are silent until they aren't.

| Severity   | Use for                                                                                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `critical` | Webhook without signature verification. Secret key in client bundle / committed to git. Charges trusting client-supplied amounts. **Spanish-business signals present in the codebase but no visible Verifactu-compliance integration (RD 1007/2023).** |
| `high`     | Missing idempotency key on a write. No event-id deduplication on webhook handlers. SCA / `requires_action` not handled. Hardcoded Stripe API version >18 months old. |
| `medium`   | Old (but live) API version <18 months. Proration not explicit on subscription updates. No handling of `invoice.payment_failed`. Logging full request/response objects. |
| `low`      | Using `Charges` API instead of `PaymentIntents` for new code. Missing `expand` causing extra round-trips. |
| `info`     | Style/observability suggestions. Documentation pointers.                                                 |

## Things this skill must not do

- Do not edit code. Suggest diffs; let the user apply them.
- Do not call any Stripe write API.
- Do not rotate keys, even if leaked. Tell the user to rotate via the dashboard.
- Do not exfiltrate secrets. If a key is found in code, redact it in the report (`sk_live_••••1234`).
- Do not pad the report. If an area passes, say "no findings" — don't invent issues.
